feat: make tools marketplace publicly browsable

**Summary**
Open tools marketplace to public browsing (read-only) while maintaining
security on tool upload and analytics endpoints. This enables the full
user discovery flow: Home → Browse Tools → Signup → Upload.

**Changes**
1. middleware.ts:
   - Removed /tools and /tools/[id] from protected routes
   - Added /tools/upload and /tools/analytics to protected routes
   - Now guests can browse tools without authentication

2. src/app/[locale]/tools/page.tsx:
   - Updated upload button logic to show different CTA for guests
   - Auth users see: "Upload Tool" → goes to /tools/upload
   - Guests see: "Upload Tool (Sign up)" → goes to /auth/signup with redirect
   - Maintains admin-only analytics button

**Security**
- ✅ Public routes: /tools, /tools/[id] (read-only)
- ✅ Protected routes: /tools/upload, /tools/analytics (auth required)
- ✅ No API changes needed (endpoints already support guest access)
- ✅ Backward compatible (no breaking changes)

**User Flow Impact**
Before: Home → Sign Up → Dashboard (tools hidden)
After:  Home → Browse Tools → Sign Up → Upload Tools

**Benefits**
- 📊 Better conversion (users evaluate tools before signup)
- 🔗 SEO friendly (tools indexed by search engines)
- 📱 Shareable (tool links work for social media)
- 👥 Closed user journey (complete funnel)
- 💰 Increased revenue (more signups → more uploads)

**Testing**
- ✅ npm run build → SUCCESS
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No ESLint warnings
- ⏳ Manual testing (guest flow)
- ⏳ E2E testing (full flow)

**Deployment**
Risk Level: LOW
Breaking Changes: NONE
Rollback: EASY (< 5 min)
